## What is this?

It's the repository for Anirudh K's and Harshil G's Synopsys Science Fair Project.

Our goal is to create a Convolutional Neural Network model that can accurately detect the presence of gum diseases, such as periodontitis and gingivitis.

Please let us know if you have any questions.
